A sample EPUB for Nintendo Power, Volume 1 (July/August 1988)

I created this magazine in the EPUB format for understanding the components that make up the EPUB format. Since the magazine is no longer active, and since the issue is from 1988, I feel as though it is safe to post the contents of the magazine here, for educational purposes only.

The content of the magazine is the work of Nintendo Power magazine and Nintendo of America (http://www.nintendo.com).

Creating The EPUB
-----------------

An EPUB is just a compressed archive of various components. For a better understanding of the components, I've posted an explanation of my findings on my blog at:

To create an EPUB file from a folder of files, you must complete the following steps, in order:

1. Create an empty ZIP archive
2. Add the `mimetype` (extensionless) file to the compressed archive
3. Add the rest of the contents to the archive
4. Rename the file from .zip to .epub
